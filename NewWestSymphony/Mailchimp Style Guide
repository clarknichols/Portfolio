# Mailchimp Styleguide

This is a non-exhaustive Mailchimp styleguide. This includes things such as:
- Color hexcodes
- Font sizes
- Font choice
- Information layout

This list will also cover:
- Use of exclamation points!
- Tone
- Citation
- Work Titles

## Text Formatting
### Fonts
In emails all font in the body should be:
- Black: hexcode `#000000`
- Font Size 18
- Font Type: Georgia
Exceptions to this rule include:
- When using italics as fine print (detailed under italics)
- When thematically appropriate
- When `#000000` would increase the difficulty of reading the text
- When indicated in a subsection

### Bold
All bolded text should be purple, hexcode `#800080`, with the following exceptions:
- It is a discount code, in which case the color should be gold, hexcode `#daa520`
- There is a color theme associated with a particular marketing campaign
- It would make the email more readable if you bolded a section sine something other than `#800080`
- It is a donor name within the Thank You To Our Sponsors section.

#### When to Use/Not Use Bold
Bold should be used:
  - Always for discount codes.
  - Sparingly when highlighting artist names for marketing Purposes (ie. "International Super-star **Yo-Yo Ma**)
  - Sparingly when highlighting work names for marketing Purposes (ie. "Buy tickets for **Beethoven's Ninth Symphony**)
  - To draw attention to ticketing deals (ie. "**Limited-time Two-for-one ticket deal ends 12/4!**)
  - Important information, such as COVID-19 policies, concert cancellation, programming changes.
    - Rule of thumb: If it alters the concert-going experience to something different than expected, it should be in bold.

Bold should not be used:
  - To emphasize adjectives, verbs, or calls to action. Bold should only emphasize nouns and ticket deals. (ie. Not "**Listen** to this **Beautiful** Piano Concerto, **buy tickets today**")
  - As a default formatting for the titles of musical works or films.
  - In excess. (ie. Not "**lorem ipsum maguns quorum this is a really long paragraph...and it's still bolded 3 sentences in. Oh gosh this paragraph is almost all bold**")

### Italics
Italics should be used in the following cases
- Work and Film Titles (See NWS General Style Guide on formatting work titles)
- Sparingly for emphasis
- Concert Titles (Again, see NWS General Style Guide on use of italics)

### Titles
Header and Section Titles in mailchimp should be:
- Centered
- Font size 28
- Bolded
- Purple hexcode `#800080`

### Thank You To Our Sponsors Section
- All text lines in **Donor Section** should be center-aligned
- Donation Level Title should be font size 16 and in black, hexcode `#000000`
- Donor name should be font size 18
- Donor name should be bold and in black, hexcode `#000000`
- The distance between the `Donor Level Title` line and the `Donor Name` line should be one press of the enter key. ie:
>             Grandioso Sponsor
>               **John Hammer**  
- Donor levels should have 1 line of blank space between them. ie:
>              Grandioso Sponsor
>                **John Hammer**
>                 [blank line]
>                Largo Sponsor
>                **John Cena**

### Buttons
- Font for all buttons should be Arial
- All Buttons should be color `#2baadf`
- Font color for all buttons should be white `#FFFFFF`

### Videos
- Background color should be blue `#2baadf`
- Font color for all text within the background should be white `#FFFFFF`

### Picture Inserts With a Background Frame
- Background color should be blue `#2baadf`
- Font color for all text in Picture Inserts with frame should be white `#FFFFFF`

## Style and Tone
All style and tone content here is reiterated in the Style and Tone document.

### New West Symphony
- New West Symphony should always be referred to as "New West Symphony." Never shorten the name of New West Symphony.
- New West Symphony should never be referred to as "The New West Symphony" because that is not an acceptable form of the organization's name. 
- "New West Symphony" refers to the organization as a whole, including our orchestra. If you want to refer to just the orchestra, you may use "our orchestra" or "the orchestra" or "the New West Symphony orchestra" or "our musicians."

### Tone
Tone of New West external marketing communications should always lean on the side of fun and excited, rather than artistic and esoteric. Clickbait journalism is a good source of the style to model our advertising communications. Newsletters lean more formal, and should be structured accordingly.

### Exclamation Points
- Limit use of exclamation points to once per page if possible.

### Contractions
- Contractions such as "won't" "don't" "can't" are acceptable.
- Contractions such as "you'll" or "We'll" or "we've" are not acceptable as they don't conform to New West Symphony's reputation of providing "refined" entertainment.

### Possessives
- Words ending with the letter `s` should have their possessive end with a comma, not a comma + `s`. Example "Clark Nichols' mandolin" and not "Clark Nichols's mandolin"

### "ALL CAPS" AKA.
- Do not use "ALL CAPS" at any time when writing material for marketing and development.

### Kaleidoscopic 
Limit Michael's use of the word "kaliedoscopic" to once per season. He overuses it in his program notes and his concert descriptions.
